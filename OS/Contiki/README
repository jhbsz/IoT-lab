Readme

Update: June 11th, 2014

The Contiki project has been modified to use the MSP-TS430PM64 development board with the MSP430F1611 mcu.
Board configuration is almost the same as WSN430, what has changed:
- leds configuration
- clock configuration

Some other configuration (e.g. UART) has been left untouched, although the board does not use it.
Future developments involving such (including usage of the radio/network capabilities) functionality would need to configure it correctly.
